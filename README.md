## LookBook Prototype

This project was created to continue a rapid prototype idea for an interactive wardrobe. For more information about the original idea please visit [www.michael-fernandes.com/lookbook.html](www.michael-fernandes.com/lookbook.html).

### How it works
I'm currently trying to connect [React Faux Dom](https://github.com/Olical/react-faux-dom) with a `<img>` to inorder to have the D3 interact with the overlaid svg. React unfortunately does not like rendering images in SVG namespace.
