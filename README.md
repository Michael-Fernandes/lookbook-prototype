## LookBook Prototype

This project was created to continue a rapid prototype idea for an interactive wardrobe. For more information about the original idea please visit [www.michael-fernandes.com/lookbook.html](www.michael-fernandes.com/lookbook.html).

### How it works
This app uses [React Faux Dom](https://github.com/Olical/react-faux-dom) to add interactive features to an svg outline overlayed on a .png image. This allows an user to "select" articles of clothing by hovering over the item.
